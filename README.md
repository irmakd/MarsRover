# MarsRover
Used generic methods for error handling instead of try-cache, since try-cache result cannot be watched on Console Application's command prompt window.
I limited rover number by 2, because it is required 2 rovers in the question sheet. You can change rover number by editing the for-loop at the Program.cs.
